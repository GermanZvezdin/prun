Job description
---------------

Job description is represented in the JSON formatted file. So job description
is a set of key-value pairs, where key is a certain job property. Master expects
that job description files are in the "prun/jobs" directory. So this is a good
idea to share this directory in the network for putting job descriptions from
other computers. Following job properties must be set in each job description:

- script
Path to the script file. This script file will be executed on worker computers.
If path is relative, then master will look for the file in the "prun/jobs"
directory. "script" property is closely related to "send_script" property.
If "send_script" value is false, then path must point to a script file on the
remote worker computer, thus path must be absolute.

- send_script
Whether master sends content of a script file or not. It is possible to send
script file content to workers without sharing this script file across network.
If file is large, then there is a problem of sending too much data, devouring
network bandwidth.
Also, if script file size is larger than 512 Kb, then it is necessary to set
"send_script" value to false, because of some worker's internal limitations.
