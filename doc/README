Job description
---------------

Job description is represented in the JSON formatted file. So job description
is a set of key-value pairs, where key is a certain job property. Master expects
that job description files are in the "prun/jobs" directory. So this is a good
idea to share this directory in the network for putting job descriptions from
other computers. Following job properties must be set in each job description:

- script
Path to the script file. This script file will be executed on worker computers.
If path is relative, then master will look for the file in the "prun/jobs"
directory. "script" property is closely related to "send_script" property.
If "send_script" value is false, then path must point to a script file on the
remote worker computer, thus path must be absolute.

- send_script
Whether master sends content of a script file or not. It is possible to send
script file content to workers without sharing this script file across network.
If file is large, then there is a problem of sending too much data, devouring
network bandwidth.
Also, if script file size is larger than 512 Kb, then it is necessary to set
"send_script" value to false, because of some worker's internal limitations.

- language
Script language might be one of the following: python, ruby, js, java, shell.

- priority
The smaller the integer value of the "priority" option, the higher the priority
of the job. Job with a higher priority will be scheduled before another job with
a lower priority.

- job_timeout
Job timeout in seconds. If scheduled by the master job is not completed in a
period of job_timeout seconds, then master sends "stop job" command to all job
executing workers.

- queue_timeout
All incoming master jobs are queued. If master doesn't schedule the job in a
period of queue_timeout seconds, then this job will be removed from the job
queue.

- task_timeout
Task timeout in seconds. This timeout means task execution timeout. If the
running process is not completed in a period of task_timeout seconds, then
supervising worker process will terminate it immediately.

NOTE: Negative timeout value means infinite timeout.

- max_failed_nodes
Maximum number of failed nodes whereupon job will be stopped on all workers.

- num_execution
Integer number of planned job executions. If the value is negative, then the
number of planned job executions is dependent on max_cluster_cpu property as
follows: if the value of max_cluster_cpu if negative, then the number of
planned job executions equals to the total number of cluster CPUs, otherwise
it equals to MIN( max_cluster_cpu, total_number_cpu ).

- max_cluster_cpu
Maximum number of simultaneously running instances of the job in the cluster.
Negative value means no limits.

- max_cpu
Maximum number of simultaneously running instances of the job in the single
worker machine. Negative value means no limits.

- exclusive
Exclusive job couldn't be executed simultaneously with any other job.

- no_reschedule
If the value is false, then master reassigns job from failed worker to any other
free worker, otherwise job won't be reassigned.

- hosts (optional)
List of hosts that are allowed to execute job. Empty list means no limits.

- groups (optional)
List of groups of hosts, that are allowed to execute job. Empty list means no
limits.
