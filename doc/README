Job description
---------------

Job description is represented in the JSON formatted file. So job description
is a set of key-value pairs, where key is a certain job property. Master expects
that job description files are in the "prun/jobs" directory. So this is a good
idea to share this directory in the network for putting job descriptions from
other computers. Following job properties must be set in each job description:

- script
Path to the script file. This script file will be executed on worker computers.
If path is relative, then master will look for the file in the "prun/jobs"
directory.
